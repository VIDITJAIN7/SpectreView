# 🎭 Spectre - Horror-Themed Media Player

**A custom-built VLC Media Player 3.0.21** compiled from source with integrated horror modifications. This is not just a skin - it's a complete custom VLC build featuring a dark horror-themed interface and a Lua extension that triggers random scary events during playback.

- Sensitive users
- Children
- Users with heart conditions
- Users prone to anxiety

## � Kiroween Hackathon Submission

This project was built for the **Kiroween Hackathon** using **Kiro AI** as the primary development assistant. Kiro was instrumental in:

- **Spec-Driven Development**: Used Kiro's spec feature to define requirements, design, and implementation tasks for the corrupted horror skin
- **Code Generation**: Generated Lua extension code for the horror event system
- **API Integration**: Implemented Unsplash and Freesound API integrations with Kiro's assistance
- **Documentation**: Created comprehensive documentation and setup guides
- **Debugging**: Troubleshot VLC skin XML issues and Lua extension loading problems
- **Project Structure**: Organized the codebase and created launcher scripts

The `.kiro/specs/` folder contains the full specification documents that guided the development process, showcasing how AI-assisted development can accelerate complex projects like VLC modifications.

### Kiro Development Workflow

1. **Requirements Phase**: Defined the horror-themed skin concept and extension behavior in `requirements.md`
2. **Design Phase**: Created detailed technical specifications for VLC Skins2 XML structure and Lua extension architecture in `design.md`
3. **Implementation Phase**: Broke down the work into manageable tasks in `tasks.md` and implemented each component
4. **Iteration**: Used Kiro to debug issues, refine the design, and add features like API integration and auto-loading

This spec-driven approach with Kiro enabled rapid development of a complex VLC modification that would typically take weeks to implement manually.

## 🎯 Features

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Building the Custom VLC

This project compiles VLC 3.0.21 from source with the Spectre modifications baked in.

**Requirements:**
- MSYS2 (MinGW-w64 environment for Windows)
- 2-4 hours for compilation
- ~10GB disk space

**Build Steps:**

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vlc-spectre.git
   cd vlc-spectre
   ```

2. **Install MSYS2** (if not already installed)
   - Download from: https://www.msys2.org/
   - Install to: `C:\msys64`

3. **Open MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit terminal and navigate to project**
   ```bash
   cd /c/path/to/vlc-spectre/vlc-3.0.21
   ```

4. **Run the build script**
   ```bash
   ./build_vlc.sh
   ```
   This will:
   - Install required dependencies
   - Verify Spectre files are in place
   - Configure the build with Skins2 and Lua support
   - Compile VLC (2-4 hours)
   - Create `vlc.exe` with integrated Spectre modifications

5. **Launch your custom VLC**
   ```bash
   ./launch_spectre.bat
   ```

### Alternative: Test Without Compiling

If you want to test the skin and extension separately on an existing VLC installation, see [COMPILE_AND_RUN.md](docs/COMPILE_AND_RUN.md) for quick test instructions.

## 📖 Documentation

- **[SPECTRE_SETUP.md](docs/SPECTRE_SETUP.md)** - Complete setup and usage guide
- **[AUTO_LOAD_SOLUTION.md](docs/AUTO_LOAD_SOLUTION.md)** - Technical implementation details
- **[COMPILE_AND_RUN.md](docs/COMPILE_AND_RUN.md)** - VLC compilation instructions
- **[STATUS_SUMMARY.md](docs/STATUS_SUMMARY.md)** - Project status and features

## 🔧 Configuration

### API Keys

The extension uses two APIs for fetching horror content. Keys are configured in `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "ScareConfig": {
    "UnsplashAccessKey": "YOUR_KEY_HERE",
    "FreesoundApiKey": "YOUR_KEY_HERE",
    "SearchTerms": ["scary face", "skull", "ghost", "horror", "zombie", "clown"],
    "SafeSearch": true
  }
}
```

- Freesound: https://freesound.org/apiv2/apply/

### Adjusting Scare Frequency

Edit `vlc-3.0.21/share/lua/extensions/spectre.lua`:

```lua
local CHECK_INTERVAL = 30000000  -- 30 seconds (in microseconds)
local TRIGGER_CHANCE = 5         -- 5% chance per check
```

## 🎨 Skin Customization

The skin is defined in `vlc-3.0.21/share/skins2/default/theme.xml`. You can:
- Modify button positions
- Change colors and transparency
- Adjust window size
- Add new controls

Replace assets in the `assets/` folder and run `create_vlt_package.ps1` to rebuild.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Loading
- Check VLC Messages: `Tools → Messages` (Ctrl+M)
- Set Verbosity to "2 (Debug)"
- Look for `[Spectre]` log messages

### No Scary Events Triggering
- Verify internet connection (required for API calls)
- Check API keys in `appsettings.json`
- Increase `TRIGGER_CHANCE` for testing
- Ensure media is playing (extension only active during playback)

### Skin Not Displaying
- Verify all PNG assets are in the correct directory
- Check that `theme.xml` references match asset filenames
- Try using the VLT package: double-click `spectre.vlt`

## 📊 Technical Details

### Technologies Used
- **VLC Media Player 3.0.21** - Compiled from source with custom modifications
- **MSYS2/MinGW-w64** - Windows build environment
- **VLC Skins2** - Custom UI framework (compiled into VLC)
- **Lua 5.1** - Extension scripting language (integrated)
- **Unsplash API** - Scary image source
- **Freesound API** - Scary sound source

### Key Components

1. **theme.xml** - Skin definition (VLC Skins2 XML format)
2. **spectre.lua** - Horror extension (Lua script)
3. **spectre_loader.lua** - Auto-loader interface (Lua script)
4. **Launcher scripts** - Batch/PowerShell for easy launching

### How It Works
