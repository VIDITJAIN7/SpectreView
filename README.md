# Agentic Full-Stack Skeleton

A template system for generating complete full-stack TypeScript applications through AI-assisted development. Edit template files with your app concept, run agent hooks, and get a working application scaffold in minutes.

## What This Is

This is a **generative template system** - not an application itself, but a blueprint that creates applications. It combines:

- **Template files** with placeholder markers you customize
- **Steering files** that guide AI agent behavior  
- **Agent hooks** that automate scaffolding and code generation

Think of it as a "Founder's Factory" - describe your app idea, and the system generates the complete codebase structure.

## Quick Start

### The Simple Way (Recommended)

1. **Edit ONLY `templates/requirements.md`**
   - Replace `<APP_NAME>` with your application name
   - Replace `<APP_DESCRIPTION>` with what your app does
   - Add your user stories and acceptance criteria
   - That's it! Don't touch design.md or tasks.md

2. **Save the file** → The `Auto-Generate App` hook runs automatically!
   - Generates design.md from your requirements
   - Generates tasks.md from your requirements
   - Validates everything
   - Creates complete directory structure
   - Generates all boilerplate code
   - Reports what was created

**That's it!** Your complete application is generated from JUST the requirements file.

### Advanced: Manual Control (Optional)

If you want to manually control each step or customize design/tasks yourself:

1. **Edit all three template files manually**
   - `templates/requirements.md`
   - `templates/design.md`
   - `templates/tasks.md`

2. **Run hooks manually in order:**
   - "Validate Structure" → checks everything is ready
   - "Scaffold Application" → creates directory structure
   - "Generate Boilerplate" → generates all code

### Configure Steering Files (Optional)

The `.kiro/steering/` files guide AI behavior - they're already configured with sensible defaults:

- **product.md** - Product vision and design principles
- **structure.md** - Directory layout and naming conventions  
- **tech.md** - Technology stack (React, Express, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind)

Only edit these if you want different technologies or conventions.

### Develop with Auto-Documentation

As you code, agent hooks automatically maintain documentation:

- **Save a route file** → `docs/api.md` updates automatically
- **Create a component** → Test stub generates automatically

```

## Template Placeholders

All placeholders use `<PLACEHOLDER_NAME>` format. Common ones:

| Placeholder | Example Value |
|------------|---------------|
| `<APP_NAME>` | "TaskFlow Pro" |
| `<APP_DESCRIPTION>` | "A collaborative task management platform" |
| `<ARCHITECTURE_PATTERN>` | "Client-server with RESTful API" |
| `<FRONTEND_TECH>` | "React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS" |
| `<BACKEND_TECH>` | "Node.js, Express, TypeScript" |
| `<DATABASE_TYPE>` | "Local JSON files" |
| `<DATA_MODELS>` | "User, Task, Project, Team" |

See template files for complete placeholder reference.

## Generated Application Stack

Applications generated by this skeleton use:

**Frontend**
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Zustand for state management
- React Router for navigation

**Backend**
- Node.js with Express
- TypeScript with strict mode
- Zod for validation
- Local JSON file storage (no database needed)

**Testing**
- Vitest for unit/integration tests
- React Testing Library for components

**Development**
- Hot reload (Vite HMR + nodemon)
- TypeScript strict mode
- Local-only (no external services)

## Agent Hooks Explained

### Automatic Hook (Runs on file save)

**Auto-Generate App** 🚀 **← THE ULTIMATE AUTOMATION HOOK**
- **Triggers**: When you save `templates/requirements.md` (ONLY file you need to edit!)
- **What it does**: Runs FOUR workflows in sequence automatically
  1. **Generate Design & Tasks** - Analyzes requirements.md and generates design.md + tasks.md
  2. **Validate All Files** - Ensures requirements, design, and tasks are complete
  3. **Scaffold Application** - Creates complete directory structure and config files
  4. **Generate Boilerplate** - Generates all backend/frontend code from data models
- **Smart Stopping**: If any step fails, stops immediately and reports what's wrong
- **Detailed Output**: Shows exactly what was created (file counts, data models, routes, components)
- **Zero Manual Work**: You ONLY edit requirements.md → complete app generated automatically

### Manual Hooks (Run on demand)

**Validate Structure**
- Scans for unreplaced placeholders
- Verifies file structure is complete
- Checks markdown syntax
- Reports what needs fixing

**Scaffold Application**  
- Creates complete directory structure
- Generates configuration files
- Creates entry points and base files
- Sets up testing infrastructure

**Generate Boilerplate**
- Reads your data models from design.md
- Generates TypeScript interfaces
- Creates API routes and services
- Generates React components and hooks
- Creates validation schemas

### Development Hooks (Run on file save)

**DocSync-API**
- Triggers when you save route files
- Parses Express routes and JSDoc comments
- Updates `docs/api.md` automatically

**TestStub-Component**
- Triggers when you create new components
- Generates corresponding test file
- Includes basic test structure with TODOs

## Example Workflow

Let's say you want to build a task management app:

1. **Edit ONLY templates/requirements.md**
   ```markdown
   <APP_NAME> → "TaskFlow"
   <APP_DESCRIPTION> → "Simple task management for small teams"
   
   Add user stories like:
   "As a team member, I want to create tasks, so that I can track my work"
   "As a team member, I want to move tasks between columns, so that I can update status"
   ```

2. **Save the file** → Auto-Generate App hook runs automatically!
   - ✓ Generates design.md (with Task, User, Project data models)
   - ✓ Generates tasks.md (with 15+ implementation tasks)
   - ✓ Validates everything
   - ✓ Creates complete app structure  
   - ✓ Generates all code (routes, services, components, hooks)
   - ✓ Reports 50+ files created

3. **Start coding** → Auto-documentation keeps docs updated

**You only edited ONE file!** Everything else was automatic.

## Why This Approach?

**Traditional scaffolding**: Generic templates, manual customization, no guidance

**This skeleton**: 
- Templates guide you to think through requirements and design first
- Steering files ensure consistent AI-generated code
- Agent hooks automate repetitive tasks
- Auto-documentation keeps codebase maintainable

Perfect for:
- Solo founders validating product ideas quickly
- Teams building internal tools
- Prototyping MVPs for user testing
- Learning full-stack architecture patterns

## Customization

### Change Technology Stack

Edit `.kiro/steering/tech.md` to use different technologies:
- Swap React for Vue or Svelte
- Use different state management (Redux, Jotai)
- Add database instead of JSON files
- Change styling approach

### Modify Directory Structure

Edit `.kiro/steering/structure.md` to change:
- Folder organization
- File naming conventions
- Import path patterns

### Add Custom Hooks

Create new hooks in `.kiro/hooks/` for:
- Custom code generation patterns
- Additional documentation automation
- Deployment automation
- Code quality checks

## Troubleshooting

**Validation fails with unreplaced placeholders**
- Open the file listed in the error
- Search for `<` to find remaining placeholders
- Replace with your actual values

**Scaffold hook doesn't create expected structure**
- Check `.kiro/steering/structure.md` matches your expectations
- Verify templates/requirements.md and design.md are complete
- Run validation hook first to catch issues

**Generated code has errors**
- Check that data models in design.md are well-defined
- Verify steering files have correct technology choices
- Review generated code and fix TypeScript errors

**Auto-hooks not triggering**
- Verify hooks are enabled in `.kiro/hooks/*.kiro.hook`
- Check file patterns match your file locations
- Restart Kiro IDE if needed

## What's in .kiro/specs/?

The `.kiro/specs/agentic-fullstack-skeleton/` directory contains the **spec for building this skeleton system itself** - it's meta-documentation about how this template system was designed and implemented. 

**You don't need to edit these files** - they're reference documentation for understanding or extending the skeleton system.

## Next Steps

1. **Review templates/** - Understand what placeholders need replacing
2. **Customize templates** - Add your app concept and requirements  
3. **Run validation** - Ensure everything is ready
4. **Run scaffold** - Generate your application structure
5. **Run boilerplate** - Generate common code patterns
6. **Start coding** - Build your features with AI assistance
